  errors:
    # By default all error messages are formatted as “%{attribute} %{message}”,
    # where “%{attribute}” is name of the attribute having erroneous value, and
    # “%{message}” is a generic error message. While this format works
    # for English, it will not work for any language in which “%{message}”
    # depends on “%{attribute}” (one example of such dependency is gender
    # agreement). We therefore change message format to “%{message}” and
    # redefine all default messages.
