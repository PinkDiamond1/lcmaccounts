------------------
* we want to prevent folks from calling myModel.destroy
because we want them to be using algorithms to do it
figure out a way to hook into activerecord so that this
happens automatically, that is, if someone calls 
myModel.destroy the algorithm DestroyModel is called.

idea: subclass ActiveRecord::Base with "Model"
make Model put in a BeforeDestroy or something
that takes control.  Would need to be able to nest
this destroy algorithm into any algorithms up the
call chain.  Hack would be to use a global top 
level algorithm variable -- if set, attach to it

also, ponder what happens with dependent destroy stuff
if a model is destroyed from an algorithm its dependent
destroys will not be destroyed via their destroy algorithm
------------------
throw validation errors in DestroyUser
------------------
Currently usernames are required to be unique
but it will happen that folks (or omniauth user
create algs) will choose the same ones -- fail
gracefully
