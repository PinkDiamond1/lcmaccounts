------------------
Destroy algorithms -- return type should somehow mate with what User.destroy gives? 
maybe delegate_to_algorithm can do that?  or it can know to hand off to a 
delegate_destroy_to_algorithm which returns true/false and sets errors?
maybe we don't want model errors at all. hmmm
------------------
  # does this constrain what this alg can return? (match destroy return)
  # how to connect into containing algorith transaction? -- single threaded can probably do with global store
  # do we disable all of the model's before_destroy and similar?

  # could say delegate destroy in activerecord::base, have that delegate
  #   to a dynamically created class figured out from the delegated method
  #   and target class -- actually could use our own fancy_delegate method
  #   that would search out the appropriate Algorithm
  #     delegate_to_algorithm :destroy -- if have unconventional algorithm ********* do this
  #     name, let coder specify
  #     we'd need this code to be loaded before the models were loaded I think


------------------
maybe user needs a state instead of temp == person.nil?
might need state for other screens during sign up process
user then like a state machine, can exist in certain non final
states and have validations that deal with that

each doorkeeper application should have an uploaded logo that we
can show on the login page
