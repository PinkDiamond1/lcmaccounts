<h3>Mark User Records As Updated</h3>

<p>Some OpenStax apps frequently poll Accounts to see which users have had their info updated.  Accounts keeps track
of which users have had updates and which applications have read them.  When you click the button below, it is as
if all users have been updated in Accounts.  Accounts will increment an "unread counter" for each user for each
OpenStax app, so that when they next ask for updated users, they'll get all users.</p>

<%= form_tag(mark_users_updated_admin_users_path, method: :put, style: 'margin: 30px 0') do %>
  <%= submit_tag 'Mark Users Updated', class: 'btn btn-primary', disable_with: "Working..." %>
<% end %>

<h3>Send Daily Student Account Count To Domo </h3>

<p>This will send the number of student accounts created the previous day to Domo. This is regularly scheduled (<a href="https://github.com/openstax/accounts/blob/master/config/schedule.rb">the schedule shown here.</a>), but
this provides an option to run it manually if needed.</p>

<%= form_tag(update_domo_admin_users_path, method: :put, style: 'margin: 30px 0') do %>
  <%= submit_tag 'Update Domo', class: 'btn btn-primary', disable_with: "Updating..." %>
<% end %>
